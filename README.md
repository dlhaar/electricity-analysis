## Introduction
This project aims to review electricity generation and consumption in Germany from 2017 through 2022.

Questions considered were:
- How has production by source changed?
- Are there any trends in the production?
- What are the consumption rates and have these rates changed?
- How do production and consumption compare?
- What is the trend for residental electricity prices?

The data for this project was retrieved from [SMARD](https://www.smard.de/en) and [Destatis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online).
